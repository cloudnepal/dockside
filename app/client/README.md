# Client Setup Instructions

1. Open a terminal and ensure you are in the client directory `cd dockside/app/client`.
2. Install third-party dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run 'npm run build' to build the `/dist` folder (used by `dockside/app/server/lib/App.pm`); or
   Run 'npm run start' to watch for code changes and rebuild automatically.
